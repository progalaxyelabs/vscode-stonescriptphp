# Extension Icon

This extension requires an icon file named `icon.png` (128x128 pixels or larger).

## Creating the Icon

1. Create a 128x128 PNG image with the StoneScriptPHP logo
2. Save it as `icon.png` in this directory
3. Update `package.json` to reference it (already configured)

## Temporary Solution

Until a proper icon is created, you can either:
1. Remove the `"icon": "icon.png"` line from `package.json`
2. Or create a simple placeholder icon

## Recommended Design

The icon should represent StoneScriptPHP - perhaps:
- A stone or rock symbol combined with PHP logo
- The letters "SSP" in a modern design
- A minimalist stone/brick pattern

Background should be transparent or use StoneScriptPHP brand colors.
